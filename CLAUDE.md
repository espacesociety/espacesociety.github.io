# Project-Specific Instructions for Claude

## Grammar and Spelling Review Learnings

- **Differentiate proper nouns from misspellings**: In sci-fi contexts, unusual terms are often proper nouns (planets, characters, technologies) rather than spelling errors
- **Common error patterns to watch for**: 
  - Possessive vs contraction confusion (its/it's)
  - Past tense verb forms (led vs lead, occurred vs occured)
  - Double consonants in words (embarrassed, accommodation, occurrence)
  - Subject-verb agreement issues
  - Missing articles (a, an, the)
- **Use MultiEdit for efficiency**: When fixing multiple errors in the same file, batch them together rather than making individual edits
- **Verify exact text before editing**: Always read the file first to ensure exact string matches, as minor formatting differences can cause edit failures
- **Track progress systematically**: Use TodoWrite to break large tasks into manageable chunks and maintain visibility of progress
- **Be thorough but focused**: Focus on actual errors rather than style preferences, especially in established content
